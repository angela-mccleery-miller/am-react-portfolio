          <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I was born a poor, white girl.  Nobody knew me and I ain't know nobody.  I was simply a nameless resident of Planet Earth...  Which is what I preferred if I had to choose between that and the name "Angie".
              
              I always wanted some great starting tag-line about myself like that.  So, thanks for humoring me.  

              I was born into an incredible family as the 2nd of 5 children, and oldest daughter.  Which meant, I was the 'mother-hen'.  I kept my only, older brother and 3 little sisters tightly in-check.  I was highly trusted by my parents and I deeply appreciated and valued their trust and the great responsibilities that came with it.  I truly appreciated a job "well done" from a ridiculously early age.

              I started babysitting for neighbors (their INFANTS, no less) at age 8.  And, I had my first job at Snowbird in the Iron Horse Lodge as a maid at age 14.  The reason I mention this, is that I had to get a ride to the bus-stop at the bottom of the canyon and then, ride the bus up to Snowbird - then, back down on the bus and wait patiently for one of my parents to pick me up afterwards.  This was WAY before the convenience of cellphones.  And, if you didn't have a dime for the pay phone.... OH MAN.  It REQUIRED patience.

              Now, on from that bit of background:  This training in my youth prepared me for decades of leadership positions within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  I raised 5 amazing human beings, 3 are now grown and making me crazy proud.  One gave me an unbelievable gift: a grandson named Kimball.  My two, last teenagers who are left at home are such strong and resilient human beings, as well.  Our overwhelming challenges, as a family, have caused my children to be very wise, very deep, but amazingly witty people who own my heart.  How grateful I am to have these strong, amazing children and the struggles, trials and "growth opportunities" that have been afforded us.
              
              I have overcome many, many obstacles in my half century on earth.  I NEVER consider being "older" as something that should count against me.  I have wisdom, experiences and self-discipline that comes with age and experience.  I have the innate ability to choose joy in stressful situations.  I have incredible grit and determination to succeed.

              I have seen this in myself attempting such 'foreign languages' in learning many coding languages at this point in my life.
